# Kiva Crowdfunding Platform Analysis
This project is a part of the ADS-507 course on Practical Data Engineering at the University of San Diego.

**Objective**
Kiva is an online crowdfunding platform to extend financial services to poor and financially excluded individuals around the world. We want to use the data to analyze the relationship between borrowers and their poverty levels. 

**Installation**
In order to access the code for this project on your own device, please do the following:

git init

git clone https://github.com/harinigautham/Practical-Engineering_ADS_507/edit/main/README.md

**Contributors**

**Project Description**
The data was found on kaggle and consists of four datasets: ‘kiva_loans’, ‘kiva_mpi_region_locations’, ‘loan_theme_ids’, and ‘loan_themse_by_region’. We will also be incorporating the ‘world_x’ dataset found in the SQL database to provide information on the various countries around the world.
